The House of Tropical Dreams can be your vacation home for Dreamin' Mexico. Located on 1/3 acre of beachfront property, the two large bedrooms in this new house each have one king-size bed and large private en-suite bathrooms. It is ideal for a small family, two couples, or a couple wanting a truly private vacation.

Tropical Dreams provides over 2,700 square feet of indoor-outdoor living space. Eleven and one-half foot ceilings emphasize the indoor space. Outside, relax on the shaded ground floor deck under 800 square feet of tile roof. For a refreshing break, cool off using the outdoor shower just off the main deck.

The 1,000 square-foot private second storey deck commands a 360-degree view of morning sunrises over the foothills of the Sierra Madres to the east, sunny days at sandy Playa Manzanillo to the south, evening Pacific Ocean sunsets to the west, and the night time lights of Lazaro Cardenas to the north. A tile roof provides 800 square feet of shade at this level.

The conveniences of a kitchen equipped with a refrigerator, gas range, drip coffeemaker, and other equipment contribute your enjoyment. Freedom from television lets you truly get away. If you really need to to keep in touch however, we provide free WiFi for those who really need to keep in contact with the outside world as well as telephone service.

The bathrooms are unusually large for Mexico... almost as large as some rental rooms in Troncones. Each bathroom has twin sinks in a six foot counter, a toilet and a "gringo-height" shower.

The living room area has a matching couch, futon sofa/bed, living room chairs and other furniture. An oak dining table with matching chairs on the lower deck permits al fresco dining.
