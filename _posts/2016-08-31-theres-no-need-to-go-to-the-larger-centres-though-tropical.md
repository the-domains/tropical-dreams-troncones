Relaxation is key in Troncones, but there are many recreational opportunities. Nearby Ixtapa features two famous 18-hole golf courses. Zihuatanejo is an internationally-known sport fishing destination. Regular fishing reports from [Mar y Tierra][0] and [Ixtapa Sportfishing Charters][1] can give you an idea what to expect for catches and rates. Zihuatanejo and Ixtapa both offer many opportunities for shopping in both designer-name fashion stores and artisan markets.

There's no need to go to the larger centres though. Tropical Dreams is located in an area noted for swimming and fishing. Playa Manzanillo is a snorkelling area, complete with coral and shellfish beds. Leisurely beach walks often include finds of decorative coral and souvenir shells. Numerous tidal pools provide natural whirlpool baths and soaking areas. And pangas (open fishing boats) can be chartered in the village of Majahua for fishing or surfing excursions.

For the more energetic horseback riding, mountain bike rentals and cave tours, and other activities can be arranged nearby in Troncones.

Nearby, well-known Punta Troncones, Playa Troncones, Playa La Majahua and Playa Saladita provide a range of surf, to both please beginners and challenge experts.

While "crabbing" may be possible, this is probably not the best way to do it.

For those who thrive on activity, there's no need to be bored at Tropical Dreams. And for those seeking relaxation, there's no better place to Dream In Mexico.
