# Beaches of Troncones Area

## Beaches South of Tropical Dreams

The House of Tropical Dreams is located on one of two points that frame Playa Manzanillo. The other point, Punta Troncones, is well-known for its left break surfing waves. Both of these points are created by lava rock formations that provide tidal pools alive with tropical fish, crabs, and other shelled creatures. 

These points shelter Playa Manzanillo from the large Pacific Ocean breaker waves making Playa Manzanillo, seen here from our upper deck, the best beach in the Troncones area for swimming and boogie boarding. Unlike some beaches on the Pacific Coast, Playa Manzanillo is sandy year 'round. And all of this starts less than five minutes walk from the back door.

The walk from Tropical Dreams, along Playa Manzanillo, to Punta Troncones is about 20 minutes, starting with dramatic lava rock, continuing with sandy beach and finishing with a large swimming pool sized tidal pool formed in volcanic rock. Surfers and swimmers usually enter the water part way along Playa Manzanillo, about 10 minutes from Tropical Dreams. 

Playa Troncones starts just south of Punta Troncones. It continues for about five kilometres, ending just south of Restaurant, at the far end of "downtown" Troncones. A long, unprotected beach, waves here are generally much larger than at Playa Manzanillo. This makes it good for surfing but even strong swimmers are cautioned at times. 

The character of Playa Troncones changes with the seasons and from year to year. During the summers and in strong current years, sand is pulled into the ocean exposing the underlying rocks in some locations. Shifting currents draw the sand back in the autumn, loading up the beaches for the winter.The character of Playa Troncones changes with the seasons and from year to year.

## Beaches North of Tropical Dreams

A hundred meters north of Tropical Dreams are two more beaches separated by a dramatic point of lava rock. These beaches are each about 40 meters long. Some guests at Tropical Dreams come to consider these as their "private beaches" because few people discover these treasures. Just past these beaches is the tip of Punta Majahua.

Punta Majahua provides protection for the beginning of Playa Majahua. Beginning at the village of La Majahua, 5-10 minutes walk north of Tropical Dreams, Playa Majahua starts as a very sandy beach with small waves. As you walk north, you'll notice that waves become larger. These waves were attractive enough to foster the development of Las Palmas resort.

Continuing north, you'll come to the mouth of Rio Lagunilla. During the surf season this will be the end of your progress as rains in the mountains will have swollen the river. From November to June however, sand usually closes the mouth of the river creating a lagoon.

Past Rio Lagunilla the sand gives way to pebbles, then rocks. By the time you reach Punta Saladita you'll be scrambling around two-meter tall boulders. The walk from Tropical Dreams to Punta Saladita can provide a variety of experiences in a morning or afternoon. Plan at least three hours for this walk. Be sure to pack water with you, bring or wear good walking shoes, and wear a hat.
